Sort Without Articles
Project Overview
A JavaScript application that sorts text lists while intelligently ignoring common English articles ("the", "a", "an"), ensuring proper alphabetical organization based on meaningful words.
The Challenge
Standard alphabetical sorting places "The Beatles" under "T" and "A Star is Born" under "A", which isn't how humans naturally organize information. This project solves that UX problem.
What I Learned
Core Concepts

Array Sorting: Advanced use of JavaScript's sort() method with custom comparison functions
Regular Expressions: Pattern matching to identify and remove articles at word boundaries
DOM Manipulation: Using innerHTML to dynamically update page content
Text Processing: Handling case-insensitive string operations

Technical Implementation

1. Article Detection & Removal
   javascript// Used regex to match articles at the beginning of strings
   const articlePattern = /^(the|a|an)\s+/i;
2. Custom Sort Logic

Strip articles from strings before comparison
Maintain original text for display purposes
Handle case-insensitive sorting

3. Dynamic Display

Real-time sorting results using innerHTML
Clean, user-friendly interface updates

Learning Outcomes
This project reinforced that effective programming often involves understanding human expectations and translating them into logical algorithms. Sometimes the most valuable solutions address seemingly small UX friction points that users encounter daily.
